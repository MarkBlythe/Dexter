### A skeleton theme for WordPress Development.

There are several ready made WordPress theme frameworks but there are often a lot of unnecessary files.

I have created a skeleton theme with all of the vital files and some optional extras that I have found really useful in many previous sites. 

This theme can be used for any WordPress build and due to its simplicity it can be expanded for any size website essentially saving those tedious first few hours setting up a new build.

A demo WordPress build can be found here [http://mcb.codes/dexter/demo] it leaves a lot to the imagination but then this theme was built to be bare anyway. Feel free to customise to your hearts content.
